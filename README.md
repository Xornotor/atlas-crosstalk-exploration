# crosstalk

- Function to generate the g(t) signal in an LAr calorimeter cell.
-     cellFunction(t): t is the sampling time desired
- Function to generate the capacitive crosstalk (XT) signal for a neighbor cell.
-      XTalk(t): t is the sampling time desired
- Functions to plot histograms to compare distributions.
